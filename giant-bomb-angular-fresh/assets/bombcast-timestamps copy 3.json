Which means you very quickly end up being around 10-15 levels above the recommended level for all of the story beats throughout the base game. That has made the slow start far more bearable and honestly pretty cruisey.\n\nIn a lot of cases you end up being strong enough to solo lower level dungeons if you wish to do that to farm some gear or just stuff for fashion. Though I would recommend doing them properly with full parties of level synced players for more exp and challenge, so that you can learn to play your class in proper scenarios.\n\nIt feels like the exp rate being this high allows a lot of extra freedom to experiment for newer players and has definitely made the early going experience a lot more fun, more fun than probably what Matt Rorie is going through currently as you can switch classes and not spend very long leveling them up. I'm definitely making the most of it to level up my crafting classes high enough to let me be pretty self sufficient.\n\nThe story is \"fine\"there is a very clear point in the \"base game\"where the story jumps from what I'd rate as a 4-5 to an 8 and that also helped spur me on towards the expansions. I think the Expansions being way better is probably a result of them having time to sit down and do things properly, where as the base game was being made in a hurry while they were simultaneously trying to fix 1.0. The base game story isn't awful, it's just not all that thrilling. But there is a plot there worth following I think, and even now before I head into the first expansion it has been noticeably better than the beginning 40 or so levels",
